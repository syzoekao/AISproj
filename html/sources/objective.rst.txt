Project description
===================

The objective of the project is to predict the risk of aquatic invasive species (AIS) invasion 
of each waterbody in Minnesota. To account for the risk, we constructed the boater movement network
and the river connection network between waterbody in Minnesota. The report document include

1. :ref:`Data`
2. :ref:`Predictive Model`
3. :ref:`Predictive Results`
4. Simulation of risk of AIS invastion 

	* Data
	* Calibration
	* Simulation
	* Intervention

5. Results
